## GCAdapterDriver
This repository contains adapter driver(s) for macOS, specifically for controller adapters that report as Gamecube controllers. In addition, this driver will attempt to opt-in to faster polling intervals ("overclocking"), which can be particularly useful in some scenarios (e.g, FGC, Slippi, Dolphin, etc).

Successfully tested on the following:

- Official adapter.
- MayFlash 4-port adapter.

This repository is fairly technical in nature - if all you want is to install support for your adapter, please [visit the project homepage](https://secretkeys.io/gcadapterdriver).

### Developing
If you'd like to try and build this yourself and/or tinker, fair warning: it's a little more obtuse than conventional macOS development. You'll likely want to temporarily disable System Integrity Protection (SIP) and/or set `systemextensionsctl developer on` if you've not got the appropriate entitlements to sign your bundle with.

### Enabling Developer Mode
- Reboot into Recovery Mode, open a terminal
- Run: `csrutil disable && csrutil enable --without kext`
- M1 Macs may need to elect for permissive boot settings here
- Reboot into normal mode
- Run: `systemextensionsctl developer on` (if you're debugging in DriverKit, this enables running extensions from outside of `Applications`)

### Kexts
- You can build the Xcode project and grab the output kext (archive)
- Note that distributing a kext built here would need to be built on a 10.13 installation.
- Copy `GCAdapterDriver.kext` to `/Library/Extensions/GCAdapterDriver.kext`
- Run `sudo chown -R root:wheel /Library/Extensions/GCAdapterDriver.kext` to ensure correct permissions are set
- Run `sudo kextutil /Library/Extensions/GCAdapterDriver.kext`. It may complain about signing; this is what we're aiming to fix in the full release.

### DriverKit
- Thankfully, (slightly) easier! Just build the Xcode app. Run it, test it.

If you have a different driver installed, you may need to make sure it's uninstalled before loading this one.

### Acknowledgements
- Thanks in particular to Nikki, Frisk, PurpleZ, and trickyd in the Slippi macOS Discord for their testing/input/review.
- The general idea for the structure this uses is borrowed from [this implementation for Linux](https://github.com/HannesMann/gcadapter-oc-kmod), albeit written with macOS nuances and frameworks in mind.
